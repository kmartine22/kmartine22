    <h2>What does the link above lead to?</h2>
    <p3> This link leads to an orginization called 4ocean, they are an orginization that helps remove trash and plastic from the ocean. They are very cool because they sell products as well to help the cause! They sell these really cool bracelets dedicated to a type of species and get this...each bracelet they make they use the plastic they find in the ocean to create them and reuse them! Not only does buying a bracelet help the cause but they are also very very cute! Some pictures of the bracelets are shown below!</p3>
