        <h2>Our Ocean</h2>
    <!-- Added about a paragraph long why the ocean is important to our planet as well as some facts. Going to talk about the big oil spill in 2000s-->
    <h1>Facts about the Ocean!</h1>
  <!-- Add more about plastic pollution and reusable items can help, insert pictures of those items as well.-->
    <p2>The ocean is 3.8 billion years old and is very important to our Earth. The ocean produces about half the oxygen in our planet. It is very important to make sure our ocean is safe and clean. As well as the animals inside of it. Plastic and oil can really destroy our oceans and the ecosystems living inside of it. The ocean is a very scary yet beautiful place (in my opinion atleast) there are many species in the ocean that are undiscoverd. Did you know that 85% of our ocean is undiscoverd...I don't know about you but that is scary but also super interesing.  </p2>

    <h3>Ways to help the ocean and resolve pollution!. </h3>

<p3>You might be asking what is one way we can help get our oceans healthier again? One way to really help reduce plastic pollution and overall pollution in our ocean is using reusable items. Using reusable items such as water bottles straws, bags instead of plastic bags and coffee mugs can help reduce the amount of plastic pollution. Simply picking up plastic when you see it on the ground or beach and throwing it away can also help our ecosystem and planet as a whole to become cleaner and healthier. </p3>

   <h4> What items can we use to help</h4>

    <p3>These are different types of reusables you can use to help decrease plastic pollution and pollution overall.</p3>
