    <p2>This website is made to help spread awareness about the ocean and the plastic in it soecifically to help make our oceans cleaner by taking actions like recycling plastic and using reusable items. Using reusable items like waterbottles, thermoses, straws and containers can help reduce the amount of plastic in our oceans and overall help save resources. Plastics in the ocean are not good for our environment so we encourage you to lower the usage of plastic or help clean up anytime you see plastic on the beach or in the water. You can also donate to help Marine animals that are in danger/injured due to the the plastic.</p2>
